# Keylogger
We will be using `Python 3.8.5` to make a keylogger.

We will be using 'pynput' to make the script work.
To install 'pynput', type the following command in CMD:
>pip install pynput

git clone the repository in C:/ drive.
The file is named 'win32.pyw', to make it look less suspicious.
Place the 'win32.pyw' and 'log.txt' files in the same directory.
Double click the .pyw file to make it record the keystrokes.

To `stop` the keylogger either press 'esc' or go to Task Manager and end all python processes
